DbContext objects are not thread safe and need to be instantiated at the top of the service layer inside each service method implementation.
I'm using the Explicit DbContext method to pass the DbContext down the stack as an explicit argument to each called repository method.
This isn't the best approach, but it is well regarded for its simplicity and ease of recognition.
